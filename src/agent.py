"""
The executor: runs an approved plan, one step at a time.

planner.py writes the plan. This file walks it:

    PLAN     ask the planner for an ordered plan
    APPROVE  show it to a human and wait -- nothing runs before they say yes
    EXECUTE  run one step, with the earlier steps' observations as context
    OBSERVE  reduce each step's output to one line: ok / thin / surprise
    REPLAN   a "surprise" may rewrite the steps that have not run yet

`run_planning_agent` is that whole loop. `execute_step` is one turn of it.

- If tool_hint is "none", write the answer directly, no tools.
- Cite any factual claim with the source URL in brackets, like [https://...].

  answer for the user. Otherwise keep it brief -- the planner needs your

            execute exactly that plan instead of drafting a new one -- an
            approval gate is worthless if the plan can change after it.
        approve_plan: human-in-the-loop gate. Called once with the plan BEFORE
            anything executes. Returning False must abort the run with zero
            tool calls. None means "no gate".
        on_step_done: progress callback so a UI can stream results. Hand it to
            the recorder; the recorder makes it best-effort.
        max_steps: cap on total plan length, revisions included.
        max_revisions: how many times the plan may be rewritten mid-run.
        per_step_tool_calls: tool-call budget inside a single step.

           rewrite what is left  then recorder.record_revision()
        6. recorder.finish()     hand back the PlanRun

    Contract:
      - Blank goal: no model call at all. stopped_reason "error", final_answer
        exactly "Please type a goal first."
      - No plan to run: stopped_reason "error" and a final_answer that tells
        the user to rephrase (must contain "couldn't draft a plan").
      - Gate refused: stopped_reason "cancelled", final_answer exactly
        "Cancelled before any tool ran.", and execute_step never called.
      - Otherwise steps execute in order, each one seeing a summary of what the
        earlier steps observed, and stopped_reason is "done".
      - An observation beginning with "surprise" may trigger revise_plan on the
        steps that have NOT run yet -- at most max_revisions times, and never
        when the queue is already empty.
      - A revision has to record the queue as it stood BEFORE the rewrite, so
