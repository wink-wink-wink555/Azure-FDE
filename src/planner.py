"""
The planner: turns a goal into an ordered plan, and revises that plan mid-run.

The agent works in two halves. This file WRITES plans; agent.py EXECUTES them.
Splitting them buys two things a reactive tool-calling loop cannot give you:

  1. The user can see and approve the plan before any tool fires.
  2. When a step surprises us, we can rewrite the steps that have not run yet.

The data shapes and the prompts are fixed. What is missing is the two model
calls and the wiring around them.

You are the Planner for an Itinerary Architect agent. The user gives you
a goal. You write a SHORT, ORDERED plan -- 3 to 5 steps, never more --
that another agent will execute.

Each step is one of these kinds, declared by `tool_hint`:
- "web_search"     : look up facts on the live web
- "fetch_url"      : read a specific webpage fully (only after a search)
- "generate_image" : make one cover image (use this at most ONCE, near the end)
- "none"           : a pure thinking step (summarize, schedule, decide)

Hard rules:
- 3 to 5 steps total. Never more.
- At most 2 "web_search" steps.
- At most 1 "generate_image" step (skip it for non-visual goals).
- The LAST step is always "none" -- it writes the final answer/itinerary.
- Steps must be ordered. Search BEFORE you fetch. Decide BEFORE you draw.

Reply ONLY with a JSON object in this exact shape, nothing else:

{
  "steps": [
    {"n": 1, "goal": "...", "tool_hint": "web_search"},
    {"n": 2, "goal": "...", "tool_hint": "generate_image"},

Decide whether to:
(a) keep the remaining steps as-is, or
(b) rewrite them to react to what we just learned.

If you keep them, return the remaining list unchanged.
If you rewrite, return a NEW list of remaining steps. You may shorten it,
re-order it, or change tool_hints, but the total run (already-done +
remaining) must still be 5 steps or fewer.

Same JSON shape as the planner. Same rules apply. Renumber so the next
step number continues from where the done-steps left off.

        max_steps: cap on the TOTAL run length, done steps included.

    Contract:
      - Uses REVISER_SYSTEM verbatim as the system message.
      - The user message must give the model everything it needs to decide:
        the goal, what has already run and how it went, what is still queued,
        and the triggering observation.
      - Returns [] when there is nothing left to revise.
      - Returned steps are renumbered to continue after the last done step, and
        the total run still respects `max_steps`.
      - NEVER raises. If the model returns garbage, the caller must not silently
        lose the steps the user already approved.

    `_parse_plan` below takes an `expect_start_at=` argument for exactly the
